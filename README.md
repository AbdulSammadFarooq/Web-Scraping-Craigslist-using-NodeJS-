# Web-Scraping-Craigslist-using-NodeJS-
This is a script of scraping a website https://sfbay.craigslist.org/d/software-qa-dba-etc/search/sof
Using this script I scraped all possible jobs with their title, description, url, time (when did a job post) and neighbourhood. 
# How to run the script?
To run this script you must have nodeJS installed. If you have not installed nodeJS yet then you can download it from this website https://nodejs.org/en/ .
After installing nodeJS you should navigate to that directly where the code is placed and open that folder in command prompt or terminal and run this command npm i request request-promise cheerio .
After that just write node index.js and you will get the scraped data.
